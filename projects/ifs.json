The back-end was initially written in C#, but was ported to Java so that it could be run on a Linux server. Rendering the fractals takes an appreciable amount of processing power, so I hosted the fractal renderer on my own computer rather than online."},

When the user submits the form, this information is validated by the server, and then it calls the Java program that renders the image. The validation was necessary because the information the user enters needs to be passed as command-line arguments."}
