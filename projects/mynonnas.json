	{"type":"p", "content":"For my International Baccalaureate Internal Assessment for Computer Science, I wrote a secure inventory-management system for My Nonna's, a group of Italian restaurant stalls in schools in Singapore. It is a web application, written in PHP with MySQL, and it keeps a database of all items that the restaurants need to stock, and whether each restaurant has performed a stock-take on a given day. When stock-takes are performed, it keeps track of any items that need to be ordered, and communicates this information to the 'admin manager' who is responsible for contacting ingredient suppliers."},
	{"type":"p", "content":"The staff in each stall regularly do a stock-take of the ingredients they have available. They use the system by scanning a special QR code, corresponding to a specific item, when that item needs to be re-ordered from the supplier. The QR codes contain a web link to a special web-page in the system, which writes the information about the item into a database table. The 'admin manager' then accesses a page which reads this table and displays all of the stalls' requests for items."},
	{"type":"p", "content":"Below is an image of the way ingredients are organized in My Nonna's. Each of the five ingredients has its own corresponding QR code, which places a new order for that item:"},

	{"type":"p", "content":"In order to ensure that there is no unauthorized ordering of ingredients or bad edits to the database, the system requires users to log in. It transmits and stores their login details securely, using PHP's implementations of bcrypt and SHA-256 for password hashing. I also made use of Bootstrap to make sure the pages of the application are laid out in a professional manner."},
